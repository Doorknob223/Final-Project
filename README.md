# Final-Project
My Project

By Connor Gardner

For this project I decided that I wanted to make an image board that alowed users to upload an image of their chooseing as well as add a caption to the image.

When the home page is first opened, it immediately opens a session and checks to see if there is a value in the 'username' catagory.
this is treated as a user being logged in or not, if the 'username' is empty it send to the login screen, this is the first thing that happens on all pages on the site,
with the exception of the login page, and the registration page, so the user can log in or make an account.
If the user does not have and account they can get to the registration page by pressing the large button at the bottom of the screen.

After the user either logs on or makes an acocunt, they immediately get sent to the homepage.
Here there is a breif summary of what the site is and what users can do.
I also included a 'Rules' section so that the users can know the rules of the image board.
At the top of the screen there is a moving bar that follows the screen if the user scrolls down.
This bar has three (3) buttons that allows the user to navigate the site, from left to right those buttons are,
'Image Board' - This takes the user to the image board page, where the main content of the site is.
'Rules' - This takes the user to the home page, there they can read the rules and about the site.
'Logout' - This alows the user to end the session and logout of their account

At the bottom of the homepage it tells the user who they are logged in as, as well as a copywrite notice
These are at the bottom of every page on the site
in the images ill be showing, ill be logged in as the user 'Mike'

Moving on to the 'Image Board' Here we can see every post that users of the site have ever uploaded in a grid consisting 4 collumns
Underneath the photo there is a small description box where the user can see who upload the image above.
At the top middle of the page there is an option to upload a file and add a caption to that file.
In preperation for the presentation I have gone ahead and upload multiple images from several accounts, they will allow me to demonstrate the full capabilities of the site.
